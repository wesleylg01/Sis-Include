 PLACING A NEW TVIDEOGRABBER ON A FORM
 ------------------------------------- 

 - create a new MFC Appwizard (EXe) application (or re-open your existing application)

 - right-click on form where the TVideoGrabber control must be place

 - click "insert ActiveX control",

 - browse the list and select "VideoGrabber VC6 Control",

 - click "Ok"

 Now you should see the TVideoGrabber component on the form. 



 CREATING THE WRAPPER FOR THE TVIDEOGRABBER COMPONENT
 ----------------------------------------------------
 
 - right-click on the form

 - click "Class wizard"

 - click "Add variable..."

 - a popup appears that says:
    "the TVideoGrabber control has not been inserted into the project" 
    "Developer Studio will do it now and generate a C++ wrapper class for it"

 - click "OK"

 - when the "Confirm Classes" dialog appears, click "OK"

 - when the "Add Member Variable " dialog appears, enter a name for the variable (e.g. "m_videograbber"), click "OK"

 - click "OK" to close the dialog

 - make a full rebuild of the the project

 - now you can reference the component by its variable name, e.g.:
   {
      m_videograbber.StartPreview();
   }
