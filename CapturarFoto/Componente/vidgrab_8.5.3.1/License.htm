<p class="dtstd_h2_license">Evaluation</p>
<p>
We offer a downloadable evaluation version to "try before you buy". Before buying we recommend you to carefully test the current release with the video capture devices and codecs you will be using. Feel free to contact us if you are facing a problem during your evaluation.
</p>


<p class="dtstd_h2_license">Third-party codecs</p>
<p>
You may have to purchase third-party codecs to be able to use certain of the features or functionalities, depending on the capture devices you plan to use and/or video formats you plan to encode or decode. 
</p>

<p class="dtstd_h2_license">Technical constaints</p>
<p>
TVideoGrabber includes real time features subject to various constaints due to the heterogeneous environments and heterogeneous behaviors of capture devices, third-party codecs, PC clock accuracies, display cards, CPU speeds, disk speeds, OS versions, firmware versions, etc..., so the TVideoGrabber features and functionalities are not guaranteed to work as expected in any case.
