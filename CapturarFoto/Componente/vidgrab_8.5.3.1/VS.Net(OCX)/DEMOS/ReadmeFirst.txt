 OCX install:
 -----------

 Be sure to register the vidgrab_NET.OCX component before using the VB6 demo projects:

 Start -> Execute -> RegSvr32 [path to the ocx]\vidbgrab_NET.OCX

 E.g. RegSvr32 c:\vidgrab\NET\vidgrab_NET.OCX


 Properties:
 ----------
 
 Some of properties included in the user guide are not published (their values are 

 not stored, so they are not visible with the object explorer), however they exist 

 and you can assign and read  their values (e.g. VideoDevice, AudioInput, etc...)


 Types:
 -----

 The types that described in the user guide begin by "Tx" in the OCX

 (e.g. "TPlaylist" in the user guide is TxPlaylist in the OCX)

 They are all listed in the "EnumeratedType.txt" file included in the package.
