 If you have developped a project with an earlier version of Vidgrab_NET.ocx
 and you get an error when opening or rebuilding your project after 
 registering the new Vidgrab_NET.ocx, like:

 . axVidgrab_NET reference not found 
 . unable to get the window handle ... WindowLess ActiveX controls are not supported

 proceed as follows:
 ------------------

 - exit Visual Studio

 - delete the "bin" and "obj" subfolders under your project's folder

 - open in Notepad you project's ".csproj" file

 - locate the reference names that contains "vidgrab_NET" (2 references)

 - modify the "Guid=..." line as follows:
   Guid = "{8945174D-2095-4007-BFC7-62ECB1EAFA9A}"

 - set VersionMajor="1" and VersionMinor="0"

   
   E.g.:
 
    ... 
                 <Reference
                    Name = "vidgrab_NET"
                    Guid = "{8945174D-2095-4007-BFC7-62ECB1EAFA9A}"
                    VersionMajor = "1"
                    VersionMinor = "0"
                    Lcid = "0"
                    WrapperTool = "tlbimp"
                />
                <Reference
                    Name = "Axvidgrab_NET"
                    Guid = "{8945174D-2095-4007-BFC7-62ECB1EAFA9A}"
                    VersionMajor = "1"
                    VersionMinor = "0"
                    Lcid = "0"
                    WrapperTool = "aximp"
                />
   ... 


 - save and close the ".csproj" file

 - open in Notepad the "...Designer.cs" file of the form(s) that contain a TVideoGrabber component

 - search for "OCXSTATE" strings, and comment all the "OCXSTATE" lines you find related to TVideoGrabber, e.g.

    // this.axVideoGrabberNET1.OcxState = ((System.Windows.Forms.AxHost.State)(resources.GetObject("axVideoGrabberNET1.OcxState")));

 - save the "...Designer.cs" file

 - reopen your project in Visual Studio

 - close all the forms opened

 - clean the current build (Build | Clean solution)

 - then make a full rebuild
