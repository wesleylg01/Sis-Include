 USER GUIDE
 ==========

 The user guide is located in the "TVideoGrabber.chm" file of the \Help folder.


 INSTALLING THE COMPONENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM
 ====================================================

 On the development platform, the TVideoGrabber_8.5.3.1.dll file must be accessible from the system path:
 (no required when distributing the application, see "SETUP AND DEPLOYMENT" below)

 - on a 32 bits development platform, copy TVideoGrabber_8.5.3.1.dll to the Windows\System32 folder 

 - on a 64 bits development platform, copy TVideoGrabber_8.5.3.1.dll to the Windows\SysWow64 folder 


  COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE
 ======================

 - TVideoGrabber_8.5.3.1.dll is the TVideoGrabber component itself, that requires one of the following DLL wrappers.

 - depending on the .NET framework version you are using, you will have to add the correponding .NET DLL wrapper as reference to your project:


   Visual Studio 2003: 
   ------------------
   use VideoGrabberNET1.1.dll


   Visual Studio 2005: 
   ------------------
   use VideoGrabberNET2.0.dll


   Visual Studio 2008:
   ------------------
   use VideoGrabberNET.40.dll (default), or VideoGrabberNET3.5.dll or VideoGrabberNET2.0.dll, according to the target framework version of your project (you can see it in your project's properties -> "Build" settings)


   Visual Studio 2010:
   ------------------
   use VideoGrabberNET.40.dll (default), or VideoGrabberNET3.5.dll or VideoGrabberNET2.0.dll (same remark as above)

   (for example if you need your application to be compatible with Windows 2000 you have to use VideoGrabberNET1.1.dll or VideoGrabberNET2.0.dll, 
   because the .NET 2.0 framework is the last version compatible with Windows 2000)


 INSTALLING THE COMPONENT ON THE VISUAL STUDIO TOOLBOX
 =====================================================

 - to install the TVideoGrabber component on the Toolbox

   . run Visual Studio

   . on the Toolbox right-click "Add/Remove items"

   . click "Browse in the ".NET Framework Components" tab of the "Customize Toolbox" dialog 

   . depending on the Visual Studio and target framework versions used, select the corresponding VideoGrabberNETx.x.DLL file.


 REFERENCE ERROR WHEN REBUILDING AN EXISTING PROJECT

   . open the project

   . in "Solution Explorer, expand "Reference"

   . delete the "VideoGrabberNETx.x.DLL" reference in error

   . right-click "Add Reference"

   . select the "VideoGrabberNETx.x.DLL" corresponding to your target framework version under the "VS.NET(DLL)" folder of the package
