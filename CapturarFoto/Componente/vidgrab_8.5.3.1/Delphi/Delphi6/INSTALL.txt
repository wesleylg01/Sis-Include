 USER GUIDE
 ==========

 The user guide is located in the "TVideoGrabber.chm" file of the \Help folder.


 PACKAGE INSTALL
 ===============

 NOTE: if you get an error when installing TVideoGrabber on the component palette, probably that you
 need to apply a Delphi update pack (see details in the "UPDATE PACKS" chapter below).


 - Exit Delphi,

 - unzip the package archive to a folder of your choice (e.g. c:\vidgrab). Be sure to unzip 
   the full directory structure (using WinZip check "use folders names" ).

 - according to your version of Delphi, copy all the Delphi\*.* archive files to your
   ...\Borland\Delphi?\Imports directory,

 - run Delphi,

 - select Component | Install packages,

 - press the "Add" button,

 - locate the TVidGrab.bpl file in the \Borland\...\Imports directory and select it,

 - Select Open

 - Click "Ok"

 - Check the "Datastead" tab in the right of the component palette. The TVideoGrabber object should 
   have been added.


 CONTEXT SENSITIVE HELP INSTALL
 ==============================

 Read the HelpInstall.txt file included in the "Help" folder of this package


 Delphi UPDATE PACKS
 ==================================
  
 TVideoGrabber has been compiled with the latest update packs applied on Delphi.


 If you get an error when installing TVideoGrabber on the component palette, e.g. like:

 "the procedure entry point ... procedure$qri ... could not be located in library Vcl40.bpl"

 you need to apply the latest BORLAND update packs on your Delphi version.


 This problem has been reported especially with Delphi 4, where you need to apply "d4upd2.exe".

 visit the following page at Borland to download the latest update packs:

 INSTALL TROUBLESHOOTING:
 =======================

 "TVidGrab.??? file not found" error when compiling or linking a TVideoGrabber project:
 - go to Tools | Environment Options | Library, and check that there is ";$(DELPHI)\Imports (Delphi)"
   in the Library path, otherwise add it at the end of the edit field.  

 - go to Project | Options | Packages, check "Build with runtime package", go to the end of the 
   packages edit field, remove ";TVidGrab", and then uncheck "Build with runtime package". 


 PACKAGE UNZIP:
 =============
 When unzipping the package, the unzip tool must re-create the package's subdirectories. By using WinZip, 
 be sure to enable the "use folder names" option, otherwise files having the same name will overwrite themselves.


 DELPHI 6 TRIAL: 
 ==============

 The trial version of Delphi 6 comes with a different DCU format than the 
 real one. You can't use TVideoGrabber or other third party components in 
 the trial, otherwise you will get the following error when trying to 
 build the project:
 Access violation at address nnnnnn in module dcc60.dll read of address nnnnn.
