 USER GUIDE
 ==========

 The user guide is located in the "TVideoGrabber.chm" file of the \Help folder.


 PACKAGE INSTALL
 ===============

 NOTE: if you get an error when installing TVideoGrabber on the component palette, probably that you
 need to apply a Delphi update pack (see details in the "UPDATE PACKS" chapter below).


 - Exit Delphi,

 - unzip the package archive to a folder of your choice (e.g. c:\vidgrab). Be sure to unzip 
   the full directory structure (using WinZip check "use folders names" ).

-  locate the RadStudio\n.0\ folder corresponding to the version used ("n" is the version number, e.g. RadStudio\9.0\'), usually:
   C:\Program Files\Embarcadero\RAD Studio\n.0\ on 32 bits platforms
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\RAD Studio\n.0\ on 64 bits platforms
   
 - copy the TVidGrab.bpl and TVidGrab.dcp files to "RAD Studio\n.0\Imports"
 
 - copy the following files to "RAD Studio\n.0\lib\Win32":
   Win32\TVidGrab.dcu
   Win32\VidGrab.dcu
   Win32\VidGrab.res 
 
  - copy the following files to "RAD Studio\n.0\lib\Win64"
   Win64\TVidGrab.dcu
   Win64\VidGrab.dcu
   Win64\VidGrab.res 

 - run Delphi,

 - select Component | Install packages,

 - press the "Add" button,

 - locate the TVidGrab.bpl file in the "RAD Studio\n.0\Imports" directory and select it,

 - Select Open

 - Click "Ok"

 - Check the "Datastead" tab in the right of the component palette. The TVideoGrabber object should have been added.


  INSTALL TROUBLESHOOTING:
 =======================

 "TVidGrab.??? file not found" error when compiling or linking a TVideoGrabber project:
 - go to Tools | Environment Options | Library, and check that there is ";$(DELPHI)\Imports (Delphi)"
   in the Library path, otherwise add it at the end of the edit field.  

 - go to Project | Options | Packages, check "Build with runtime package", go to the end of the 
   packages edit field, remove ";TVidGrab", and then uncheck "Build with runtime package". 


 PACKAGE UNZIP:
 =============
 When unzipping the package, the unzip tool must re-create the package's subdirectories. By using WinZip, 
 be sure to enable the "use folder names" option, otherwise files having the same name will overwrite themselves.
